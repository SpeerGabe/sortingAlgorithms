# sortingAlgorithms
Implementing 2 sorting algorithms(insertion sort and counting sort) in C++.

Comparison:
Insertion Sort: Performs well for small data sizes but slows down as the number of elements increases due to it's O(nÂ²) complexity.
Counting Sort: Outperforms Insertion Sort with its O(n + k) complexity but also uses additional memory proportional to the range of input values.
For 10,000 random numbers between 0 and 1000, Counting Sort ran significantly faster.

Insertion Sort Time: 176 ms
Counting Sort Time: 0 ms
